            Grit is the ability to persevere in the pursue of a long term goal in the mist of adversity and changing circumstances that stop many from achieving the goals they have set for themselves. This app started out as a pathway to help young college students who are grappling with organizing their time and manage their daily activities within the constraints placed on them by the academic requirements. This app is set to bring awareness and support for those who are willing to incorporate a long term goal into their habits as they shape their purpose in life and work towards it in small steps.
